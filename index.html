            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Yuchen Zhang, a Sensory Science 2nd-year PhD candidate at the University of Nottingham (Email: stxyz53@nottingham.ac.uk). 
                My PhD project is about consumer emotional responses towards sustainable foods. 
                The first study of my PhD involves an online survey to investigate the impact of sharing environmental information on consumer perception of protein-based products, including plant-based burger, edible insect burger and lab-grown beef burger, as well as conventional beef burger as a control sample. Consumers were randomly assigned to one of two testing conditions (blind vs. informed). In the informed condition, consumers viewed a video with
general knowledge of the different environmental impacts of a range of different foods. Consumers were also asked to imagine they were in a supermarket scenario and were selecting a burger patty for making
their dinner. For each product, they will be asked to imaging picking it from the shelf and asked about their willingness to buy, overall liking and emotional responses to each of the protein sources. Additional
informations including demographic information and personal traits (e.g. Food Neophobia, Food Disgust) were also collected to explore the relationship between their
personal traits with consumer responses to a different type of burger patties. 
Nice to meet you!</p>
